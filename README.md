The microcontroller is an ATtiny 814. Krampus has a small dev connector with 3V3, GND and the following GPIOs: PA5, PA6, PA7, PB2 and PB3. You can program using the 3-pin sneaky connector (doesn't require soldering). There are multiple ways to program so if you already have your method then you are good to go. If you have not programmed an ATtiny with UDPI then I recommend following the instructions located here to get started: <a href="https://wolles-elektronikkiste.de/en/using-megatinycore">https://wolles-elektronikkiste.de/en/using-megatinycore</a>. If you use the method described here with Arduino, you do not need to connect a resistor in series with pin 6 because this is already installed on the board.
